blindless.sh

Got sick of being unable to change the brightness on Mint 18, so wrote this to make my life a bit more bearable.

I have a symbolic link to this script sitting on my bash PATH, so it's almost as easy as having say, you know, like, a keyboard shortcut or something. Granted, this allows far more entertaining brightness adjustment possibilities.
